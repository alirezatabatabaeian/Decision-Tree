### ***Introduction:***

***A decision tree is a powerful and popular machine learning algorithm that is widely used for both classification and regression tasks. As its name suggests, a decision tree is a tree-like model that makes a sequence of decisions to arrive at a prediction or decision. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision, and each leaf node represents a class label or a numerical value. The tree is built by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the values of the features until a stopping criterion is met.***

### ***Implementation:***

***In this project, we’ve learned a decision tree to predict the annual income of people based on features such as their nationality, gender, career and … .***

***Also, the pruning has been implemented to increase the accuracy and reduce the model’s depth.***

***The results will be shown on the below graphs :***
